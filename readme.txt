[B]Requirements:[/B] @cba_a3

[B]Version:[/B] v3.4.4
[B]Signed:[/B] Yes

[B]Short description:[/B] An advanced and realistic name tag system designed to simulate real world recognition conditions. 

[B]Description:[/B]
Shows the names of nearby players when you hold down the key.
Factors such as time of day, fog, zoom, group membership, ranks, line of sight, optical zoom (factoring in simulated atmospheric distortion), thermals and voice are taken into account in order to make recognition as realistic as possible.
This has been separated out of the ZAM mods collection and is where you should get zam_showNames.

[B]Features:[/B]
[LIST]
	[*] Shows player names
	[*] Displays ranks (optional)
	[*] Name tag size corresponds linearly with distance
	[*] Name tag fade's depending on distance and other factors (optional)
	[*] Recognizes zoom (with any optics or no optics) and resizes name tags accordingly (optional)
	[*] line of sight is considered by taking into account terrain and objects
	[*] Passenger name tags are optimized
	[*] Time of day taken into account to simulate the necessity for ambient lighting and\or NVGs to ID people
	[*] Arma 3 enhanced fog is taken into consideration when determining ID range (optional)
	[*] Smaller name tags are displayed for ruck sacks, named after it's last owner (optional)
	[*] Fellow group member names are much bolder to aid in ID (optional)
	[*] Knowledge system, allowing normally unknown men to be discovered (by approaching them) or already fully known (such as HVT\VIPs) (optional)
	[*] Knowledge system also allows adding name tags to any object (such as crates and mission critical items)
	[*] Players using TFAR or ACRE direct speak is indicated by a red name tag, with redness indicating how loud they are predicted to be (taking into account shout, whisper, etc) (optional)
	[*] Performance demands of main loop and ACRE support configurable in userconfig (Arma scheduler permitting)
	[*] Mission maker can force the enabling or disabling of optional features
	[*] Key can be used as toggle or hold by setting in userconfig
	[*] Detects if thermal is used and disables name tags (TI is bad at ID IRL).
	[*] Show group names for other groups. Togglable with a key (default Ctrl-y). (optional)
	[*] Show team names for current group (optional)
[/LIST]

[B]Installation:[/B] 
Standard mod installation with @folder. You will also have to copy the userconfig folder from the mod folder to your root Arma 3 directory (eg: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Arma 3\userconfig). 
Otherwise you will get an error stating somehting along the lines of: z"am_shownames.hpp not found".
I intend on deprecating this requirement in the futurem once a better mod configuration method comes along.

[B]Included Files:[/B] 
zam_shownames.pbo

[B]Usage[/B]:
Press y (or another key configured in Main Menu, Configure -> Controls -> Configure Addons -> ZAM -> showNames) to show the names of all players on your side and name tags of rucks used by players.
Note that the key options will appear in that menu only 5 seconds into the game.

(Mission makers) Disable by setting: zam_showNames_enabled = false
Before 5 seconds into the game.
Other options are available and can be set the same way as zam_showNames_enabled.
The following is a list of all the options being set to their default values:
[LIST]
	[*] zam_showNames_enabled = true;		// Enable the mod
	[*] zam_showNames_toggle = false;		// Use the key in toggle mode; Tap to turn on, tap again to turn off. As opposed to hold down to keep on.
	[*] zam_showNames_ranks = true; 		// Enable ranks
	[*] zam_showNames_rucks = true; 		// Enable rucks
	[*] zam_showNames_group = true; 		// Enable group differentiation (using boldness)
	[*] zam_showNames_group_names = true; 		// Enable group names for other groups
	[*] zam_showNames_group_teams = true; 		// Enable team names for current group
	[*] zam_showNames_fade  = true; 		// Enable fade of name tag with distance
	[*] zam_showNames_fog   = true; 		// Enable fog to exaggerate fade
	[*] zam_showNames_magn  = true; 		// Enable magnification effect (only for temporary zoom)
	[*] zam_showNames_knowledge = true;		// Knowledge system
	[*] zam_showNames_voice = true; 		// Support for TFAR and ACRE
	[*] zam_showNames_var_pressLoop_delay = 0.005;	// For adjusting the performance of shownames (smaller is better)
	[*] zam_showNames_var_acre_eh_delay = 0.1;	// For adjusting frequency at which player acre activity is monitored (for Voice feature)
[/LIST]

Client side mod
Multiplayer and single player support
